# Network

The purpose of this website is to give readers a clear understanding of the partnerships of all authors in the radiomics studies (Updated every five years, now from 2013 to 2017).

We presented the relationship map in a dynamic network. In this network, mouse interactions are available if the reader wants to get more information from the dynamic network. For the clarity of the display, a threshold (cooperation count >3) was used in the network.
